## Capture the flag(CTF): The security game of developers

 What is CTF?  Most of the developer are familiar with this CTF as this is the doorway for taking the first step in the field of security.  Any developers first priority is security.  They don't want to leave a door open in their site for hackers to exploit.  now,  how do they gain the experience to protect their site?  CTF provide exactly that. Its a playground for developers to play and learn what threats their site can face in the real world and how to fix them without risking their products.
Like many competitions, the skill level for CTFs varies between the events. Some are targeted towards professionals with experience operating on cyber security teams. These typically offer a large cash reward and can be held at a specific physical location. Other events target the high school and college student range, sometimes offering monetary support for education to those that place highly in the competition!
CTFs can be played as an individual or in teams so feel free to get your friends onboard!
